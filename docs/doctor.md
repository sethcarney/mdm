# mdm doctor

Check the health of installed skills and project markdown files.

`mdm doctor` runs a series of local checks and prints a report grouped by category. It covers skill installation integrity, agent symlinks, and any markdown files large enough to strain agent context windows — including instruction files, skill content, and general project docs.

## Checks performed

### Skills

For each skill recorded in the lock file:

| Check                      | What it catches                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Directory exists           | Skill was deleted from disk after install                                       |
| SKILL.md present and valid | Missing file or frontmatter without `name`/`description`                        |
| Symlinks resolve           | Agent-specific links (e.g. `.claude/skills/my-skill`) point to a missing target |
| Hash matches lock          | Skill files were modified manually since install                                |
| Markdown file sizes        | `.md` files inside the skill directory are too large                            |

### Instruction files

Checks every known agent instruction file in the project root for size:
`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.clinerules`, `.roorules`, `GEMINI.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and others.

### Rules linking

For each agent recorded in `configuredAgents` that has a unique instruction file (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`, `.windsurfrules`), checks whether that file exists and is symlinked to `AGENTS.md`. If not, warns you to run `mdm rules link`.

### Skill coverage

For each configured agent whose rules file is already linked, checks that every installed project skill has a corresponding entry in that agent's skills directory. Catches the case where you add a new agent via `mdm rules link` but haven't re-run `mdm skills add` to distribute existing skills to it.

### Agent sandboxing

For each [sandbox](sandbox.md)-supported agent that is configured in the project or detected on your machine (Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI), runs the `mdm sandbox status` baseline checks and warns about any below-baseline items — for example a missing `.claude/settings.json`, an OS sandbox that isn't enabled, or `filesystem.denyRead` not blocking secret reads. Run `mdm sandbox setup` to apply the recommended baseline.

### Project markdown

Walks the entire project tree and flags any other `.md` file that is too large. Skips directories already covered above and common noise directories (`.git`, `node_modules`, `vendor`, `dist`, `build`, `.next`, etc.). Stops after 10,000 filesystem entries to avoid hangs on very large repositories.

### Size thresholds

| Size     | Severity                                           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| ≥ 20 KB  | Warning — may strain agent context windows         |
| ≥ 100 KB | Error — likely too large for agent context windows |

## Output

```
Project skills:

  ✓ my-skill
    .agents/skills/my-skill

  ✗ broken-skill
    ✗ skill directory not found on disk — run `mdm skills install` to restore

  ▲ large-skill
    ▲ SKILL.md is 45KB — may strain agent context windows

Instruction files:

  ▲ CLAUDE.md is 32KB — may strain agent context windows

Rules linking:

  ▲ Windsurf (windsurf) is configured but .windsurfrules is missing — run `mdm rules link` to create it

Skill coverage:

  ▲ Cursor (cursor) is configured but skill "my-skill" is not installed for it — run `mdm skills add` to include it

Project markdown:

  ▲ docs/reference.md is 28KB — may strain agent context windows

Doctor complete: 3 skill(s) checked, project markdown scanned, 1 error(s), 4 warning(s)
```

Each skill shows a `✓` (ok), `▲` (warning), or `✗` (error). The summary line always prints, even when no skills are installed, so you know the checks ran.

## Commands

```
mdm doctor       Check project and global skills, plus all project markdown
mdm doctor -g    Check global skills only (skips project markdown scan)
mdm doctor -p    Check project skills and project markdown only
```

### Flags

| Flag            | Description                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `--global, -g`  | Check global skills only                       |
| `--project, -p` | Check project skills and project markdown only |

### Examples

```bash
# Full check — skills (both scopes) + all project markdown
mdm doctor

# Only check globally installed skills
mdm doctor -g

# Only check project skills and local markdown
mdm doctor -p
```

## Common issues and fixes

| Issue                                | Fix                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Skill directory not found            | Run `mdm skills install` to restore from the lock file                        |
| Skill content modified               | Run `mdm skills update` to sync back to the source version                    |
| Broken symlink                       | Re-install the skill with `mdm skills add`                                    |
| Instruction file too large           | Split content into smaller files or remove outdated sections                  |
| Large project markdown               | Trim the file or exclude it from agent context                                |
| Rules file missing or not linked     | Run `mdm rules link` to symlink the agent's instruction file to `AGENTS.md`   |
| Skill missing for a configured agent | Run `mdm skills add` and select the agent to distribute existing skills to it |
